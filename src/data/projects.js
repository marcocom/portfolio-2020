      Stadia streams gaming-experiences to users across any Chrome-enabled device, and the
      Chromecast is most underpowered of them by far. This required building our client and UI
      at a completely raw level, using Google's proprietary DART.js as our only framework and library. Performance was
      shrewdly achieved with pure CSS animations, requiring minimal repainting, while achieving
      a rich game-console feel in its opening-introductions, and game-menu system.`,
