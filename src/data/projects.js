      produce hesitation and flashing, as the screen is asked to repaint rapidly. My
      trick/solution was to load dynamic sequence images in a z-ordered stack. This
      allowed the browser to load all images into resident memory, then re-ordering the
      stack could be done smoothly at up to 120fps! This is also how i was able to now
      colors and fade from one to the other. I used this technique alot for products,
      especially cars, that needed to be seen by the user from all angles, while keeping
      the render and color quality to the high standards we would demand of our images.
      It still works in javascript today, but im sure someone has probably made a
      library for it by now.`

      `Tony Hawk's popular game was set to release with a completely new concept, a physical
      skateboard, as a human interface device to control your gameplay. It was pretty steep cost
      increase for a single game, and so we needed to create a website that could showcase
      the game, its peripheral controller, and encourage user-engagement through sharing on
      social networks. Streetwise Studios provided the writing and creative-direction, and I did concept and production in Flash.`,

      `Streetwise Studios, now defunct, handled a lot of Activision game brand work in print and television, and was
      hired to consult with them on their first interactive project. Handling a client like this can take a lot of practice
      to engage in fully, whereby your client has powerful creative talent and capabilities, and a large vacuum of experience
      in doing code-based production and the many pitfalls that a designer must mindful of avoiding with over-application of
      shadowing, masking, animation, and other CPU or raster-intensive operations to achieve a unified work of art. `,

      `Skuemorphism was a bit over-applied, in retrospect, as the look required
      drop-shadowing on all elements to create realism, and as elements animated, that became
      very intensive. I remember struggling to keep animations smooth on low-end machines, and
      having to invent a logic that would remove the effect when monitored-framerates were lagging for users (a sorely missed feature of Flash today). A
      common design-challenge, in video-game brands of that era, was the publisher's desire to extend
      the look & feel from game to website, which often was too heavy. Learning how to negotiate
      this creatively took trial and error to overcome.`,
