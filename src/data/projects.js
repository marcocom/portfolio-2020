      `Timeego was the result of a four-month project class, in which our team of three conceived, designed and developed a web application. We used an Agile design methodology to build this app. The final project was judged on good UX/UI, complete documentation, and overall functionality.`,
      `The original pitch for this app was to build something that would allow students to log their time studying, and view their total study time in each course. This would help students track, manage and ultimately improve their study habits. I'm proud to say the finished product lives up to this original idea.`,
      `The feature I'm most proud of in this app is the working stopwatch that can be used to track study times. It was built using object-oriented programming, and uses local storage to save it's state. This allows the time to persist across different page loads without the need for a true backend.`,
      `When we started coding, we quickly realized we would have a lot of different JavaScript files. To improve our codes organization, we implemented a Model-View-Controller design pattern. This ultimately made the finished product much easier to navigate.`,

      `When one of my close friends asked me to build him a portfolio website, I jumped on the opportunity. I saw this as a great chance to learn something new while practicing my web development skills.`,
      `My biggest challenge building this site was making it so Cody could manage his own content without any outside help. Originally, I planned on using the MERN stack to accomplish this. However, when I heard about Gatsby and how easy it makes it to dynamically render new pages, I opted to try that approach instead.`,
      `Ultimately, the finished site is built using the JAM stack. Gatsby is used for the front-end while the Contentful headless CMS stores the sites content. GraphQL then queries Contentful to get content to display on the site. This setup means Cody can manage all his own content.`,

To keep the site simple to use, I tried to keep the amount of information on the screen to a minimum. I also used this project as an opportunity to use Sass for the first time. Doing this really increased the speed that I could write my CSS.`,
