Before almost any documentation existed, I have been designing web multimedia and programming in Flash's Actionscript code subsystem to produce new media solutions that seek to break the conventions of HTML through animation and more interactive navigation and feedback. Flash was a good front-end application of my schooling in graphic design, my C and BASIC programming experiments on my Commodore64 from age 11 and also drew on my working experience and interest in film and visual FX production. Flash is a complex tool to completely know and be proficient in, and so a lot of my business has been filling the high demand for websites and kioske/CDROMs built upon or integrated tightly with the Flash plugin." />
